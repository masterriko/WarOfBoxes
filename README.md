# War-of-boxes
## Description of the project:
At the beginning of the game both players spawn with bases. This is a two player game (on one keyboard), where players generate boxes that spawn next to their base. The boxes start moving towards the enemy base. Each player has a number of coins that generate over time or when a player destroys another player's box. There is also gold spawned between the bases, where the probability of a higher value is decreasing (not all coins are equal by value).
The player who first destroys the enemy base wins.
